<h1 class='title'>Christmas 2014</h1>

_You hear the sound like a machine breathing…a small house appears before your very eyes. The front door opens, 6 heads peek out._

Are we back? Is it 2014? Oh, thank goodness. (Glenn walks out, drops to the ground and kisses their grassless lawn) You’ve no idea where we’ve been. You see, we moved into this house a year-and-a-half ago, only to realize:

* It’s bigger on the inside (but still small)
* It’s a TARDISH (Time and Relative Dimension in Space House…a time machine)

The house took off just before Christmas last year, which explains why the 2013 Christmas letter was not published. Well, that’s not entirely true. It was published, but in 1639 Salem, Massachusetts. As such, everyone treated it as witchcraft and pursued us to the ends of the land. We were only able to escape by filming them with our smartphones and telling them we had their souls in our “image  boxes”. This adventure was doubly-scary, as Jill is a certified witch and would burn like a wooden duck.

Oh, and if you don’t believe us, here’s a [link to the 2013 letter](/christmas/2013)

We’ll try to sum up our adventures in time and space over the last year here. We never know when the TARDISH is going to take off, or when and where it’s going to go. 

Logan travels have taken him to a dimension of braces-wearing teenagers called Teenatopia. This may be the most frightening place that the TARDISH took us. There were some good things, like Logan doing well at the middle school. However, some items are too hellish to relive. Bipolar teenage outbursts around subjects that Logan had no prior (or current) knowledge or interest in. At one point, it felt like the Goodrichs were filming a sequel to Cybil starring Cliff Clavin. Also, Logan is obsessed with soccer, joining a local competitive club so he could complain about the refs in a more competitive setting. The other families on the soccer team MUST be from the future, because the only way to get to all the practices and games on time is to use time and space travel. We think the other players may be able to clone themselves, as well.

Emma’s travels through time and space this year took her to much nicer places. She landed in Gymnastia, a land inhabited by cartwheeling and back-handspringing girls. They seem to communicate via gymnastic moves. Here are (what we think is) a few translations:

* Front Tuck: “Can we have a sleep over?"
* Back handspring: “Why not?"
* Front handspring: “Everyone else’s parents let them!"
* Double back handspring to a twist split followed by a slammed door: “Tell the Littles to stay out of my room. AHHH!”

Emma is also in middle school this year, and doing quite well. Her school dimension overlaps a bit with Logan’s, but instead of braces and polarity, they have cats and Instagram.

Lily landed in a world of dramatists (Actasia) and was instantly made their Supreme Thespian. The Actasians lifeblood is created by making huge deals out of mundane situations. Every mole hill is a mountain. There is constant ambient noise that sounds like a weak groan. Still, the Actasians had never seen anything like Lily, who upped their “natural resource” by nearly tenfold on her first day. Lily is in the final year of “Lower El”, meaning 3rd grade. She enjoys soccer, but not on Logan’s level. Lily seems to see the ball as something that just belongs in the goal, so she puts in there. Also, all her drama powers seem to be non-existent on the pitch, which is nice.

The smallest of the time travelers, Becca, spent most of last year in a desolate place where everything is not fair. We call it Karmaworld. The phrase “THAT’S NOT FAIR” seems to mean different things based on how loud it is said and how long it is said.  For example:

* “That’s not fair” means “I didn’t know what else to say, so I went with this. I am not upset."
* “THAAAAT’S NOOOOOOT FAAAAAAAIR” means “I am on the verge of a nuclear meltdown. I am somewhat upset."
* <that’s not fair, said at a frequency only dogs can hear> means “I don’t care for asparagus!"

Becca is in first grade and very literal. She was asked to write the timeline of her life backwards, so she wrote it ALL backwards, meaning the words were like “enilemit”. The little one spent some time in Gymnastia with Emma, but could really only learn how to say “One-handed cartwheel", which means “That’s not fair.”

Once Jill realized the enormity of time and space, saving just Earth seemed lazy. So, she thought working for all of the non-profits in all the dimensions we visited was the way to go. Here is a list of non-profits where Jill contributed:

* The Fair Foundation (Karmaworld)
* Tumbling to Kindness (Gymnastia)
* The Children’s Foundation for Not Talking to Me in That Tone (Teenatopia)
* Mothers Against Drama (Actasia)

Jill handled the time and space travel much better than the rest of the family, as she is used to having to be in multiple places at once on an impossible schedule. “Time and Space travel has nothing on raising four kids,” she says.

Glenn’s year was full of humanoid-like beings that live for soccer and geeky stuff. This land is called Kycknerdia, and they mainly communicate through digital means. The spoken word is looked upon as a filthy form of communication. Outside of the digital world, it is possible to have rudimentary discussions with Kycknerdians using soccer constructs, such as juggling a ball or megging (kicking a ball between their legs) them. One should be careful, though, as megging can be construed as an act of war. Glenn’s time in Kycknerdia is, however, coming to an end this year. 2015 will bring a new adventure for Glenn at Skookum (really) where the communication ways aren’t much different, but they have health insurance.

When the family wasn’t in their different dimensions, they were doing some travel around 2014. Summer was especially full of voyages, including Logan's first solo (meaning, sans the Goodrichs) trip with his Boy Scout troop to Utah. They had a great time camping, hiking through canyons, and destroying Logan's hammock. 

The part of the family that gets to have all the fun (meaning, everyone except Glenn) met Grammie in Butler Beach, Florida for a week of beach fun.

While other families were wasting Spring Break on vacation, our favorite time-travelling family landed on a "working" farm. The trip highlighted all stages of farm life, including birth (baby goats), death (a horse), and hot-tubbing (really, the farm cabin had a hot tub). While on Spring Break, the family also visited the famous Biltmore(link) that Emma likes SOOO much she vomited. 

There was also another trip to Hilton Head where the kids communicated with a crab-like species using a technique called “Crabbing” (pic). Thanksgiving brought a road trip to Atlanta to see family, followed by a trip to the Chattanooga Dimension. Chattanoogans are a happy lot, as they have an infinite number of TVs and game consoles, as wells as the ability to sled on grass. 

The animals of the house spent time in various dimensions, as well. Zoe (the dog) was lost on a planet of arthritic dogs that lie around and move as little as possible. Space travelers refer to it as The Furry Fat Zone, and Zoe was very comfortable there. Skylar, aka Floofy the cat, has always lived in a world ruled by felines. Being a cat, Skylar sees the world as a land of servants to shed on, solicit for petting, and then randomly scratch and bolt under the bed. Jingles, the guinea pig, was transferred from Emma’s care to Lily’s and has, thus, seen a better time and space. Jingles now is treated more like a pet and less like a filth-collecting, unwatered, how-is-this-thing-still-alive thing. And then there’s Clara (the frog) and Mouse (the fish)…. that’s it, enough said.

We are hoping that 2015 lands the Goodrichs more in the time and space dimensions of our friends and family. If you fancy an adventure, come and see us. You never know what you’ll find.

As always, we hope the coming year is your happiest! (Note: We’ve already seen next year for you, and it’s a good one! :)"

The Goodrichs
