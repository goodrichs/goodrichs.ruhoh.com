Every quest has a core figure, a ringbearer, and this quest's is Jill. She is the creator of the quest, the curator of the quest, and the only reason it had a chance to succeed. 

You have to remember that the clan had no idea this quest was in their future. They just thought Jill was finally going mad. There were weeks that rooms were rearranged, multiple times. Then Jill started being seen with purveyors of land.  She would ask Glenn to take oddly circuitous routes home through settlements close to where the kids take their lessons. 

Then, things got really unsettling. Jill started randomly telling people the clan was leaving. "Where?", they'd ask. "WHAT???", Glenn would say. Jill would respond with vacant stares and incoherent mumblings. At times, it looked as if Jill would have to "visit the country", if you catch our meaning.

It took a mysterious, inexplicable series of events to bring life to the quest and acceptance to the clan. A family (that we're convinced where hired by Thornhillians to nudge thing along) showed up at the estate and offered to purchase it that same day. Even stranger, this family already had an estate in Thornhill. Almost that same day, an estate came available up north, one that was close to labor and lessons. This "miracle" estate was being offered by people that agreed to accept the paltry amount that the clan could offer. To this day, Glenn is convinced that witchcraft was involved.  

(Don't forget, Jill is a certifed witch. Really.)

With the quest to move behind her, Jill has turned to her next quest: Employment. The clan's little ones are all in school now, and the new estate is too small to rearrange furniture every day.

Step one of the Quest for Employment has involved substitute teaching. Jill actually subbed for one teacher for 3 straight weeks.
