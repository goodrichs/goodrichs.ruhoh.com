  <h1 class="xmas2013" style="text-align:center">Follow the Quest</h1>
  <p>
    Join our merry (in olden days, merry meant “loud and numerous” and was not intended to pleasant) band on their quest to new lands. Tis true, the Goodrich Clan has migrated north to the Urban Lands of Charlotte. The reasons for this quest are myriad. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Thornillian people, who so graciously hosted the family over the last decade, strongly encouraged the quest. In fact, they hired a family to buy the old Goodrich estate sight-unseen to ensure all ties to Thornhill would be broken completely. Furthermore, many Thornhillians toiled for hours to assist the Goodrichs in their move (just a bit further) north.
      </li>
    <li>The labors and lessons in each of the family members' lives had grown too distant. Glenn and Jill, tired from each day's long journey into the village, ached to be closer to both work and teachings.
      </li>
      <li>
      Jill, as some of you may have guessed, is affected. The Nomadic Plague lives within this one, and when it flares up, she becomes mad with the need for change. Symptoms include frothing at the mouth and an incessent berating of Glenn about moving. It is truly sad to behold
    </li>
    </ul>

    This story chronicles the journey of each member of the clan, along with stops along the way, and those brave enough to visit. It is a tale for the ages, if you can take "ages" to mean "very, very silly."

  <h3>doggie & the claw</h3>

  <p>
    the leader of the animals is clearly the claw. this merciless feline even scares the goodrichs, often reminding them who is boss by leaving a dispatched mole by the back door. doggie is simply a frightened follower of the claw, often becoming stiff as a board when the cat approaches. the claw uses doggie to in his backyard landmine scheme, ensuring the yard is blanketed in little, stinky bombs for the family to clean up. 
  </p>

  
  <p>
    their latest caper is the pignapping of jingles, a mild-mannered guinea pig. jingles is kept in a cage that is constantly guarded by one of these other pet fiends, who taunt the pig endlessly.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <img src="{{urls.media}}/images/xmas2013/jingles.jpg" style="float:left;margin:5px"alt="help me!"/>
    <p>
      jingles: [really high-pitched squeak]
    </p>
    <p>
      doggie: ow! can you take it down a few frequencies???
    </p>
    <p>
      the claw: it puts the catnip on its skin or else it gets the hiss again.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>  
    the claw has yet to make his demands for jingle's release known, but we're guessing it's tuna-related.
