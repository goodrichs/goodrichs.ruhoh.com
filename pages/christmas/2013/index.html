  <h1 class="fontface" style="text-align:center">Follow the Quest</h1>
  <p>
    Join our merry (in olden days, merry meant “loud and numerous” and was not intended to pleasant) band on their quest to new lands. Tis true, the Goodrich Clan has migrated north to the Urban Lands of Charlotte. The reasons for this quest are myriad. 
    * The Thornillian people, who so graciously hosted the family over the last decade, strongly encouraged the quest. In fact, they hired a family to buy the old Goodrich estate sight-unseen to ensure all ties to Thornhill would be broken completely. Furthermore, many Thornhillians toiled for hours to assist the Goodrichs in their move (just a bit further) north.
    * The labors and lessons in each of the family members' lives had grown too distant. Glenn and Jill, tired from each day's long journey into the village, ached to be closer to both work and teachings.
    * Jill, as some of you may have guessed, is affected. The Nomadic Plague lives within this one, and when it flares up, she becomes mad with the need for change. Symptoms include frothing at the mouth and an incessent berating of Glenn about moving. It is truly sad to behold

    This story chronicles the journey of each member of the clan, along with stops along the way, and those brave enough to visit. It is a tale for the ages, if you can take "ages" to mean "very, very silly."

      her efforts to evade justice lead jill to take criminally long road trips (think: wagon trains) with the children. she also inserts herself as a leader in all her kids' activities, thus ensuring their successful indoctrination. her mantra is to rob from the rich and give to the earth.

      logan is rapidly becoming a master of western outlaw ways (by which, we mean minecraft and flag football) and is the family scout. his ability to  mention exactly what he is thinking, without regard to context or tact, is legendary in the old west.

      emma is the creative one of the bunch, leaving many of her telltale creations on the various crime scenes. she is also the annie oakley of reacting to the word 'no' and seems to be attempting to secure her place as the leader of the family.

      lily is the emotional loose cannon. if caught, she would give up the family in a matter of seconds. however, lily seems to be protected by her many animals and insects. somewhat talented at disguise, lily is the dramatic, little goodrich flower.

    <p class="pic_blurb">
      the most frightening and loud character in the family is also the tiniest: little becca boo. often sent in to a soon-to-be crime scene as a cute distraction, becca then disables security with ear-splitting, endless chatter. becca is the reason the family has no need of explosives.

  <h3>doggie & the claw</h3>
  <img src="{{urls.media}}/images/xmas2013/pets1.jpg" style="float:left;margin:5px"alt="help me!"/>
  <p>
    no outlaws work alone, and the goodrichs had a couple of the furriest and most fierce helpers in the business: doggie (a.k.a. zoe) & the claw (a.k.a. skylar). 
  </p>

  <img src="{{urls.media}}/images/xmas2013/pets2.jpg" style="float:right;margin:5px"alt="help me!"/>
  <p>
    the leader of the animals is clearly the claw. this merciless feline even scares the goodrichs, often reminding them who is boss by leaving a dispatched mole by the back door. doggie is simply a frightened follower of the claw, often becoming stiff as a board when the cat approaches. the claw uses doggie to in his backyard landmine scheme, ensuring the yard is blanketed in little, stinky bombs for the family to clean up. 
  </p>

  
  <p>
    their latest caper is the pignapping of jingles, a mild-mannered guinea pig. jingles is kept in a cage that is constantly guarded by one of these other pet fiends, who taunt the pig endlessly.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <img src="{{urls.media}}/images/xmas2013/jingles.jpg" style="float:left;margin:5px"alt="help me!"/>
    <p>
      jingles: [really high-pitched squeak]
    </p>
    <p>
      doggie: ow! can you take it down a few frequencies???
    </p>
    <p>
      the claw: it puts the catnip on its skin or else it gets the hiss again.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>  
    the claw has yet to make his demands for jingle's release known, but we're guessing it's tuna-related.
