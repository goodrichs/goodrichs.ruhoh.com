  <h1 class="xmas2013" style="text-align:center">Follow the Quest</h1>
  <p>
    Join our merry (in olden days, merry meant “loud and numerous” and was not intended to pleasant) band on their quest to new lands. Tis true, the Goodrich Clan has migrated north to the Urban Lands of Charlotte. The reasons for this quest are myriad. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Thornillian people, who so graciously hosted the family over the last decade, strongly encouraged the quest. In fact, they hired a family to buy the old Goodrich estate sight-unseen to ensure all ties to Thornhill would be broken completely. Furthermore, many Thornhillians toiled for hours to assist the Goodrichs in their move (just a bit further) north.
      </li>
    <li>The labors and lessons in each of the family members' lives had grown too distant. Glenn and Jill, tired from each day's long journey into the village, ached to be closer to both work and teachings.
      </li>
      <li>
      Jill, as some of you may have guessed, is affected. The Nomadic Plague lives within this one, and when it flares up, she becomes mad with the need for change. Symptoms include frothing at the mouth and an incessent berating of Glenn about moving. It is truly sad to behold
    </li>
    </ul>

    This story chronicles the journey of each member of the clan, along with stops along the way, and those brave enough to visit. It is a tale for the ages, if you can take "ages" to mean "very, very silly."

    The animals of the clan have been transformed by the quest. Zoe, once obedient and loyal, has become a incessent food burgler. Sklyar was not a fan of the quest, disappearing for 2 weeks once the family reach their destination (really). The crooked necked feline did eventually reappear
