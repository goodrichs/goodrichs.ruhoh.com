Welcome to the Goodrich 2014 Groundhog Day Newsletter. Yes, you read that right, Groundhog Day. We tried to get a holiday letter out around the end of December, but were hit with a major case of Writer’s Block. At that point, the decision was made to punt on the usual holiday tome and just send out the typical “Hey, Look at These Photos of Our Beautiful Family Doing Fun Things and, Often, Dressed in Matching Outfits” photo card with a generic holiday message and be done with it. 

However, this option hit the following road blocks: 

* “Beautiful” is not really an adjective that is conjured up when you look at pictures of the Goodrichs. In fact, here is the only picture that even came close to meeting the Holiday Photo Card minimum standards:

*  If, at any point, you catch us all dressed in a matching outfits, it means we're naked.

So, as that option (and it’s appetite-crushing images) went down the drain, we ignored the problem. Maybe no one would notice the lack of our holiday communications, maybe the world was a nicer place without a multi-page newsletter.  Maybe, just maybe, we should get some matching outfits.

Ignoring the problem, unfortunately, didn’t work. About a week after the holidays, we started getting questions such as:

* “How are we meant to feel better about our family if we don’t read about yours?”
* “Do you realize how much harder it is to start our post-Christmas bonfire without the several pages from your letter?”
* “What do you think of our matching outfits?”

Frankly, we didn’t have very good answers to these questions. By this point, however, the holidays were well in our rearview mirror. We needed a good reason to publish the letter.

Thank God for Groundhog Day. Here are the rules for this year’s events:

* If Logan sees his shadow, it’s totally uncool.
* If Emma sees her shadow, it means she has her new contacts in.
* If Lily sees her shadow, it’s part of her interpretive dance.
* If Becca sees her shadow, it must be deaf.

With that out of the way, on to updating you on the Goodrichs’ 2013. You should probably get comfy, this could take a while.
