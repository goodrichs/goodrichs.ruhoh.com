Lily's quest in 2013 was one of arts and music. After spending previous years in the Drama Highlands, Lily found herself on the way to The Valley of Interpretive Dance. 

Here, little girls dance to many songs, except for the one currently playing. The dances can each only be performed once, then they are lost to the annuls of time and gratitude. There are many pirouettes, uncomfortable pauses, and writhing on the ground. All in all, these dances resemble an old school, evangelical healing without the healer.

Beware, however, as the dances cannot be comfortably seen by anyone over the age of 8. Any adult that finds themselves accidentally watching one of the dances is immediately captivated, in much the same way a deer is captivated by oncoming headlights. The frozen spectactor is only released at the end of the song, and must then seek a hasty escape, lest they be drawn into the next dance and the halls of madness.

When Lily is not in the Valley, she spends much time in the plateaus of Little Girl Fantasy. Here, every boy "likes" her and she is going to marry all of them. She and her friends ride scooters up and down the street and to the playground. 

Finally, Lily competes in the local soccer contests. Soccer at Lily's age consists of 4 girls protecting the ball from the other players, while the remaining players smile at the ground or their parents vacantly. Every so often one of the girls regains consciousness, takes the ball down very deliberately and scores. The whistle blows, signalling to all players to prance back to their "position" and strike a pose. Lily spent one game in continuous interpretive dance and scored 3 times. 

Lily loves the family's new estate, as she can literally dance to school in minutes. She is a happy 2nd grader with a growing love of reading.
