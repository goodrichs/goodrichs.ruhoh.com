Logan's quest is one of teenhood. 2013 was the the last of the pre-teen years for Logan, and his preparations for the teen years began in earnest. The boy, as is customary at this age, was suddenly given the abilty to immediately declare the coolness of all things. Actually, the ability seems to be to declare the uncoolness of all things, as Logan has tagged all things uncool. Here are some of the items Logan marked 'uncool' with his new talent:

* Homework
* Reading
* Braces
* Girls/Sisters
* Standing
* Pants
* Ice skating

Here is a rare photo of Logan casting his spell while ice skating:

By the end of the year, Logan was truly become a master of his new craft.

However, such gifts are not without a price. It seems the path to teenhood is strewn with perils. Logan seems to have be stricken by a Spell of Hormones, causing him to spin into wild fits over inconsequential events. Here is a transcript of once such fit:

*Mom*: Hey Logan, how was school today?
*Logan*: (Conjuring) Uncool.
*Mom*: Oh. Could you pass me the potatoes?
*Logan*: OH MY GAWD! WHY DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING??!! DO YOU HATE ME?? (runs to room, slams door)

He will emerge from his room sometime later, seemingly free of the recent attack and with almost no memory of it at all. 

We been told that many on the path suffer from such maladies, and that they usually pass. Only time and Glenn's patience will tell.
