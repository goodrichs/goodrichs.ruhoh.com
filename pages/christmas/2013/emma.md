Emma started her quest bespectacled elf in search of way to do cartwheels. The problem with glasses and cartwheels seems obvious, yet difficult to overcome. The clan consulted some medicine men near the middlestate of Raliegh and decided to have a procedure done to Emma's left eye. While the procedure was not a full success, it did have the intended effect of relieving Emma of her glasses and replacing them with contacts.

With the largest hurdle to more cartwheels vanquished, Emma joined a local troop of Acrobats run by some local young, Christian men. Emma practices her acrobatics with other girls 123 times/week. The culmination of these practices was a December holiday show. Strangely, this show lacked a couple of things, namely, acrobatics and a ending. Seriously, it is over a month since that show began and Glenn swears it is still happening, the audience cursed to watch until the end of time...

Emma is also on her way to Tweentopia, a place where reading is "awesome", and boys are (thankfully) not allowed. Cats are first-class citizens in Tweentopia, and Emma is entranced,  speaking in strange tongues when one is near.

*Emma*: I think I'll go and read a book  (Cat walks in the room) AAWWWW! IT'S SOOO FLOOOOOOOFY! FLLOOF FLOOF FLLOOOFY! C'MERE FLOOFASAURUS REX! (Cat rockets out of room into one of many cat hiding places)

Tweentopia is a good spot for Emma, one we should can fortify her reactions to the word "no" and continue to thinks boys are gross. Glenn is working on spell to trap Emma here for years to come.
