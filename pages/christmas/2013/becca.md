The dwarf of the clan is continually on a quest of discovery. When you are in kindergarten, life is an endless series of new experiences and sensations. Becca treats each experience like the Highlander, where she seems to absorb them. The main difference is, where the Highlander gained strength each time, Becca gains volume.

Becca really has discovered reading this year. She'll be the first to tell you so, reading out LOUD every word she sees. Many in the clan have nightmares that they've been hit with a spell that shrinks them and Becca, dropping them into a dictionary.

Becca aspires to bit a bit of an acrobat as well, following Big Sister Emma to weekly practice. Becca's class also had an holiday "spectacular" that, frankly, reminded us of a flea circus, with one very loud flea reading everything in between stations.

>That sign says "Merry Christmas" (flips onto mat)
>That says "Vault", (cartwheels)
>That says "Balance Beam" (falls off beam)
>My dad is holding a sign that says "Zip it!" (somersaults)

The acrobatic coaches have yet to request Becca for upcoming events.

The new location has met with Becca's approval, since she can ask her teacher a question by walking out the front door and yelling "HEY MISS MAGGIE, WHAT BOOK DID YOU WANT US TO READ??" and Miss Maggie can hear her.
