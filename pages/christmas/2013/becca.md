The dwarf of the clan is continually on a quest of discovery. When you are in kindergarten, life is an endless series of new experiences and sensations. Becca treats each experience like the Highlander, where she seems to absorb them. The main difference is, where the Highlander gained strength each time, Becca gains volume.

Becca has discovered reading this year. She'll be the first to tell you so, reading out LOUD every word she sees. Many in the clan have nightmares that they've been hit with a spell that shrinks them and Becca, dropping them into a dictionary.

Becca aspires to be a bit of an acrobat as well, following Big Sister Emma to weekly practice. Becca's class also had an holiday "spectacular" that, frankly, reminded us of a flea circus, with one very loud flea reading everything in between stations.

>That sign says "Merry Christmas" (flips onto mat)
>That says "Vault", (cartwheels)
>That says "Balance Beam" (falls off beam)
>My dad is holding a sign that says "Zip it!" (somersaults)

The acrobatic coaches have yet to request Becca for upcoming events.

Finally, the littlest Goodrich has been cursed with the inability to identify someone as a stranger. She treats every living thing as a family member, often climbing into the lap of total strangers in restaurants, movies, and the other cars at stoplights. Many of the recipients of Becca's fawnings think it's cute, at first. Glenn likes to toss Becca a book, like he's pulling the pin, and sprint away. Most of the victims don't remember much after that.
